High IMAP4, POP3, or Outlook Anywhere latency can indicate problems with Client Access servers rather than Mailbox servers. This is especially true when other clients (which includes MAPI) latency is lower in comparison. In some instances, high IMAP latencies could indicate a bottleneck on the Mailbox server in addition to the latencies that the Client Access server is experiencing.</description><applications><application><name>MSExchange Client</name></application></applications></item><item><name>ExchangeIS Client Type\RPC Requests</name><key>perf_counter[&quot;\MSExchangeIS Client Type(*)\RPC Requests&quot;]</key><delay>30s</delay><applications><application><name>MSExchange Client</name></application></applications><triggers><trigger><expression>{avg(#3)}&gt;70</expression><name>MSExchangeIS Client Type\RPC Requests</name><url>https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/samdrey/2015/01/26/exchange-2013-performance-counters-and-their-thresholds/</url><priority>WARNING</priority></trigger></triggers></item><item><name>ExchangeIS Store(*)\RPC Average Latency</name><key>perf_counter[&quot;\MSExchangeIS Store(*)\RPC Average Latency&quot;]</key><delay>30s</delay><units>ms</units><applications><application><name>MSExchange Store</name></application></applications><triggers><trigger><expression>{avg(#3)}&gt;100</expression><name>MSExchangeIS Store(*)\RPC Average Latency</name><url>https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/samdrey/2015/01/26/exchange-2013-performance-counters-and-their-thresholds/</url><priority>WARNING</priority></trigger></triggers></item><item><name>Exchange Mailbox IS RPC Operations/sec</name><key>perf_counter[&quot;\MSExchangeIS Store(*)\RPC Operations/sec&quot;]</key><delay>30</delay><value_type>FLOAT</value_type><units>/sec</units><description>Indicates the current number of RPC operations occurring per second.&#13;

Should closely correspond to historical baselines. Values much higher than expected indicate that the workload has changed, while values much lower than expected indicate a bottleneck preventing client requests from reaching the server.&#13;
