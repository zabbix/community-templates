# Zabbix Integration: Home Assistant Monitoring

**Template:** `Home Assistant - Zabbix`  
**Zabbix Version:** 7.0+  

---

## 💡 Overview

Agentless monitoring of Home Assistant entities via the REST API:  
- Fetches all `entity` states from Home Assistant (`{$HA.URL}/api/states`)  
- Discovers entities (automations, sensors, switches, cameras, zones, etc.) via Low-Level Discovery (LLD)  
- Extracts state, values, and attributes (e.g., battery level, temperature, disk usage)  
- Applies JSON preprocessing and value mappings to normalize data  
- Generates dependent items and trigger prototypes for various entity types

---

## 🔍 Requirements

- Home Assistant instance with REST API enabled  
- Long-Lived Access Token stored in macro `{$API.TOKEN}`  
- Accessible URL `{$HA.URL}` (e.g., `http://192.168.10.121:8123`)  
- Template applied to a Zabbix host with network access to HA
