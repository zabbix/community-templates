            The global remaining system capacity (in seconds).
            EVS server remaining capacity (in seconds). This
            is the total capacity still available for new
            AV content. This includes all internal and all
            external storages currently active in this server
            configuration. The value is an estimation based
            on the configured video codec bitrate and number
            of audio channels. It assumes that all new AV
            material will be ingested trough the recorders.
            Any new AV material , with other AV format than
            defined in configuration, imported through the
            XNET or Gigabit interfaces may induce estimation
            errors.
            According the server is running in Loop mode
            or not remaining capacity concept varies.
            In Non-Loop mode, when a recorder is running,
            remaining capacity decreases accordingly. All
            the recorded AV material is considered as protected
            material.
            In Loop mode (default mode), remaining capacity
            is decreasing only when a new clip is created
            (protected). Recorded material is not considered
            as protected and thus remains available for future
            record. Recorder will 'loop' to old material
            to overwrite it with current input one.
