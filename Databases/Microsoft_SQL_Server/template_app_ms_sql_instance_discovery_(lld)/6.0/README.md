Values greater than 1 or 2 indicate that we are having table / Index page scans. If we see high CPU then we need to investigate this counter, otherwise if the full scans are on small tables we can ignore this counter. A few of the main causes of high Full Scans/sec are • Missing indexes • Too many rows requested Queries with missing indexes or too many rows requested will have a large number of logical reads and an increased CPU time.</p>|<p>**Expression**: {Template App MS SQL Instance Discovery:perf_counter[" {#INSTANCES}:Access Methods Index Searches/sec",300].last()}/{Template App MS SQL Instance Discovery:perf_counter[" {#INSTANCES}:Access Methods Full Scans/sec",300].last()}>1000</p><p>**Recovery expression**: </p>|warning|
|{#INSTANCES}:Access Methods Page Splits/sec|<p>Number of page splits per second that occur as the result of overflowing index pages. Interesting counter that can lead us to our table / index design. This value needs to be low as possible. If you find out that the number of page splits is high, consider increasing the fillfactor of your indexes. An increased fillfactor helps to reduce page splits because there is more room in data pages before it fills up and a page split has to occur. Note that this counter also includes the new page allocations as well and doesn’t necessarily pose a problem. The other place we can confirm the page splits that involve data or index rows moves are the fragmented indexes on page splits.</p>|<p>**Expression**: {Template App MS SQL Instance Discovery:perf_counter[" {#INSTANCES}:Access Methods Page Splits/sec",300].last()}>0.2*{Template App MS SQL Instance Discovery:perf_counter[" {#INSTANCES}:SQL Statistics Batch Requests/sec",300].last()}</p><p>**Recovery expression**: </p>|warning|
|{#INSTANCES}:Buffer Manager Buffer cache hit ratio|<p>This counter indicates how often SQL Server goes to the buffer, not the hard disk, to get data. The higher this ratio, the less often SQL Server has to go to the hard disk to fetch data, and performance overall is boosted. Unlike many of the other counters available for monitoring SQL Server, this counter averages the Buffer Cache Hit Ratio from the time the last instance of SQL Server was restarted. In other words, this counter is not a real-time measurement, but an average of all the days since SQL Server was last restarted. In OLTP applications, this ratio should exceed 90-95%. If it doesn't, then you need to add more RAM to your server to increase performance. In OLAP applications, the ratio could be much less because of the nature of how OLAP works. In any case, more RAM should increase the performance of SQL Server OLAP activity.</p>|<p>**Expression**: {Template App MS SQL Instance Discovery:perf_counter[" {#INSTANCES}:Buffer Manager Buffer cache hit ratio",300].last()}<90</p><p>**Recovery expression**: </p>|warning|

|{#INSTANCES}:Buffer Manager Page lookups/sec|<p>Number of requests to find a page in the buffer pool. When the ratio of page lookups to batch requests is much greater than 100, this is an indication that while query plans are looking up data in the buffer pool, these plans are inefficient.

|{#INSTANCES}:Latches Total Latch Wait Time (ms)|<p>Total wait time (milliseconds) for locks in the last second. Note: For “Lock Wait Time” it is recommended to look beyond the Avg value. Look for any peaks that are close (or exceeds) to a wait of 60 sec. Though this counter counts how many total milliseconds SQL Server is waiting on locks during the last second, but the counter actually records at the end of locking event. So most probably the peaks represent one huge locking event. If those events exceeds more than 60seconds then they may have extended blocking and could be an issue. In such cases, thoroughly analyze the blocking script output. Some applications are written for timing out after 60 seconds and that’s not acceptable response for those applications.</p>|<p>**Expression**: {Template App MS SQL Instance Discovery:perf_counter[" {#INSTANCES}:Latches Total Latch Wait Time (ms)",300].last()}>60000</p><p>**Recovery expression**: </p>|warning|

|{#INSTANCES}:Locks _Total Lock Waits/sec|<p>This counter reports how many times users waited to acquire a lock over the past second. Note that while you are actually waiting on the lock that this is not reflected in this counter—it gets incremented only when you “wake up” after waiting on the lock. If this value is nonzero then it is an indication that there is at least some level of blocking occurring. If you combine this with the Lock Wait Time counter, you can get some idea of how long the blocking lasted. A zero value for this counter can definitively prove out blocking as a potential cause; a nonzero value will require looking at other information to determine whether it is significant.</p>|<p>**Expression**: {Template App MS SQL Instance Discovery:perf_counter[" {#INSTANCES}:Locks(_Total) Lock Waits/sec",300].last()}>0</p><p>**Recovery expression**: </p>|warning|
