        ## Description
        
        An mysql template create for halley.it
        
        ## Overview
        
        Here is my template for monitoring **MySQL on a Windows server with multiple instances**. The logic for this monitoring is: 
        
        
        Script will take 2 parameters: variable ($1) and port ($2). Variable 1 will be the word for what script will looking for in script results file. The first zabbix request will generate a file : mysql\_results\_$PORT.txt. All next requests in 55 sec will take the values from this file, not from mysql. If the file is over 55 sec, file is rewriten. This assure to have 3 db request for all 117 items
        
        
        **Steps to install:**
        
        
        1. Create C:\script
        
        
        2. Copy in this folder the script mysql\_stats.py
        
        
        3. in zabbix agent add at UserParameters
        
        
        UserParameter=mysql-stats[*],c:\script\mysql\_stats.py "$1" "$2" # user parameter for show extended status - no grants needed
        
        
        UserParameter=mysql.ping[*],mysqladmin -u -p --host=127.0.0.1 -P"$2" ping # -P"$2" will tahe the port number, who is the second variable from request
        
        
        4. Create a different host for every MySQL instance and specify in host Macros the MySQL port {$PORT}
        
        
        5. Add template Halley MySQL Server mi passive. I use passive items beacause not need to specify host name as hostname of the client. Don't forget to enable on host agent the passive monitoring
        
        
        6. Check the data:
        
        
        a0) from client command line run c:\script\mysql\_stats.py Uptime Port
        
        
        a) from zabbix server with command zabbix\_get -s host\_ip -k "mysql-stats[Uptime,$port]"
        
        
        a1) from zabbix server with command zabbix\_get -s host\_ip -k "mysql-stats[log\_bin,$port]"
        
        
        b) Look in Latest data
        
        
        Don't forget:
        
        
        1. Specify port in host macros
        
        
        2. Install Python on server and when will install select custom install and check for all users
        
        
        All files are on https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ag6IN4i1M9MuhXQZZpQ5dn2t4MCy
        
        
        **P.S.**
        
        
        This template include description with advices for items and triggers. I spend over a month to get best practices from MySQL Enterprise Monitor, another mysql templates or just mysql documentation. A feedback from you will be nice

            The number of connections that were aborted because the client died without closing the connection properly. 
            If this value increments, it usually means there’s been an application error, such as the programmer forgetting to close MySQL connections properly before terminating the program. This is not usually indicative of a big problem.

            The number of internal on-disk temporary tables created by the server while executing statements. Accessing tables on disk is typically slower than accessing the same tables in memory. So queries that use the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE syntax are likely to be slow when this value is high. Must be ass low ass possible. Best 0
            
            If an internal temporary table is created initially as an in-memory table but becomes too large, MySQL automatically converts it to an on-disk table. The maximum size for in-memory temporary tables is the minimum of the tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size values. If Created_tmp_disk_tables is large, you may want to increase the tmp_table_size or max_heap_table_size value to lessen the likelihood that internal temporary tables in memory will be converted to on-disk tables.
            
            You can compare the number of internal on-disk temporary tables created to the total number of internal temporary tables created by comparing the values of the Created_tmp_disk_tables and Created_tmp_tables variables.

            The basics of its architecture are simple. An event is a stored routine with a starting date and time, and a recurring tag. Once defined and activated, it will run when requested. Unlike triggers, events are not linked to specific table operations, but to dates and times. Using the event scheduler, the database administrator can perform recurring events with minimal hassle. Common uses are the cleanup of obsolete data, the creation of summary tables for statistics, and monitoring of server performance and usage."

                "The Event Scheduler is a very useful feature when enabled. It is a framework for executing SQL commands at specific times or at regular intervals. Conceptually, it is similar to the idea of the Unix crontab (also known as a ""cron job"") or the Windows Task Scheduler.
                
                The basics of its architecture are simple. An event is a stored routine with a starting date and time, and a recurring tag. Once defined and activated, it will run when requested. Unlike triggers, events are not linked to specific table operations, but to dates and times. Using the event scheduler, the database administrator can perform recurring events with minimal hassle. Common uses are the cleanup of obsolete data, the creation of summary tables for statistics, and monitoring of server performance and usage."
                Advice:
                "Enable the Event Scheduler and use it to automate recurring events. Add the line event_scheduler=1 to the [mysqld] section of your my.cnf/my.ini file so the variable is set properly when the server is restarted.
                
                Recommended Action
                SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;"

            The binary log captures DML, DDL, and security changes that occur and stores these changes in a binary format. The binary log enables point-in-time recovery, preventing data loss during a disaster recovery situation. It is used on master replication servers as a record of the statements to be sent to slave servers. It also enables you to review all alterations made to your database.
            However, the number of log files and the space they use can grow rapidly, especially on a busy server, so it is important to remove these files on a regular basis when they are no longer needed, as long as appropriate backups have been made. The expire_logs_days parameter enables automatic binary log removal.

            If this is set to a nonzero value, all tables are closed every flush_time seconds to free up resources and synchronize unflushed data to disk. This option is best used only on systems with minimal resources.
            If flush_time is set to a non-zero value, all tables are closed every flush_time seconds to free up resources and synchronize unflushed data to disk. If your system is unreliable and tends to lock up or restart often, forcing out table changes this way degrades performance but can reduce the chance of table corruption or data loss. We recommend that this option be used only on Windows, or on systems with minimal resources.

            This variable indicates the number of filesystem accesses MySQL performed to fetch database indexes. 
            Performing filesystem reads for database indexes slows query performance. If this variable is high, it indicates that MySQL's key cache is overloaded and should be reconfigured.
            If Key_reads is large, then your key_buffer_size value is probably too small. The cache miss rate can be calculated as Key_reads/Key_read_requests.

                There are two potential security issues with supporting the LOCAL version of LOAD DATA statements:
                The transfer of the file from the client host to the server host is initiated by the MySQL server. In theory, a patched server could be built that would tell the client program to transfer a file of the server's choosing rather than the file named by the client in the LOAD DATA statement. Such a server could access any file on the client host to which the client user has read access.
                In a Web environment where the clients are connecting from a separate web server, a user could use LOAD DATA LOCAL to read any files that the web server process has read access to (assuming that a user could run any statement against the SQL server). In this environment, the client with respect to the MySQL server actually is the web server, not the remote program being run by the user who connects to the web server."

            If set to 0, table names are stored as specified and comparisons are case-sensitive. If set to 1, table names are stored in lowercase on disk and comparisons are not case sensitive. If set to 2, table names are stored as given but compared in lowercase. This option also applies to database names and table aliases. For additional details, see Section 9.2.2, “Identifier Case Sensitivity”.
            
            On Windows the default value is 1. On macOS, the default value is 2.
            
            You should not set lower_case_table_names to 0 if you are running MySQL on a system where the data directory resides on a case-insensitive file system (such as on Windows or macOS). It is an unsupported combination that could result in a hang condition when running an INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... FROM tbl_name operation with the wrong tbl_name letter case. With MyISAM, accessing table names using different letter cases could cause index corruption.
            
            An error message is printed and the server exits if you attempt to start the server with --lower_case_table_names=0 on a case-insensitive file system.
            
            If you are using InnoDB tables, you should set this variable to 1 on all platforms to force names to be converted to lowercase.
            
            The setting of this variable in MySQL 8.0 affects the behavior of replication filtering options with regard to case sensitivity. (Bug #51639) See Section 17.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”, for more information.
            
            It is prohibited to start the server with a lower_case_table_names setting that is different from the setting used when the server was initialized. The restriction is necessary because collations used by various data dictionary table fields are based on the setting defined when the server is initialized, and restarting the server with a different setting would introduce inconsistencies with respect to how identifiers are ordered and compared.

                The case sensitivity of the underlying operating system determines the case sensitivity of database and table names. If you are using MySQL on only one platform, you don't normally have to worry about this. However, depending on how you have configured your server you may encounter difficulties if you want to transfer tables between platforms that differ in filesystem case sensitivity.
                Advice:
                Set lower_case_table_names=1 in your my.cnf/my.ini file and restart your MySQL server. Note that if you plan to set the lower_case_table_names system variable to 1 on Unix, you must first convert your old database and table names to lowercase before restarting mysqld with the new variable setting.

            Using multiple threads when repairing MyISAM tables can improve performance, but it can also lead to table and index corruption as reported by several bugs (#11527, #11684, #18874). Even though these bugs have been fixed, this feature is still considered beta-quality, as noted in the manual.

            This variable controls the password hashing method used by the PASSWORD() function. It also influences password hashing performed by CREATE USER and GRANT statements that specify a password using an IDENTIFIED BY clause.
            
            The following table shows, for each password hashing method, the permitted value of old_passwords and which authentication plugins use the hashing method.
            
            Password Hashing Method	old_passwords Value	Associated Authentication Plugin
            MySQL 4.1 native hashing	0	mysql_native_password
            SHA-256 hashing	2	sha256_password
            If you set old_passwords=2, follow the instructions for using the sha256_password plugin at Section 6.5.1.4, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”.
            
            The server sets the global old_passwords value during startup to be consistent with the password hashing method required by the authentication plugin indicated by the default_authentication_plugin system variable.
            
            When a client successfully connects to the server, the server sets the session old_passwords value appropriately for the account authentication method. For example, if the account uses the sha256_password authentication plugin, the server sets old_passwords=2.

            2 or DEMAND	Cache results only for cacheable queries that begin with SELECT SQL_CACHE.
            This variable defaults to OFF.
            If the server is started with query_cache_type set to 0, it does not acquire the query cache mutex at all, which means that the query cache cannot be enabled at runtime and there is reduced overhead in query execution.

            This variable is deprecated and will be removed in a future MySQL release. It is always enabled and attempting to disable it produces an error.
            
            Server startup fails with an error if this variable is enabled and the privilege tables are in pre-4.1 format. See Section 6.5.1.3, “Migrating Away from Pre-4.1 Password Hashing and the mysql_old_password Plugin”.

                "Prior to MySQL 4.1, password hashes computed by the PASSWORD() function were 16 bytes long. As of MySQL 4.1 (and later), PASSWORD() was modified to produce a longer 41-byte hash value to provide enhanced security. However, in order to allow backward-compatibility with user tables that have been migrated from pre-4.1 systems, you can configure MySQL to accept logins for accounts that have password hashes created using the old, less-secure PASSWORD() function, but this is not recommended.
                
                WARNING: One of the system variables used in this advisor (secure_auth) is deprecated and has been removed in MySQL Server 8.0. Please plan ahead accordingly."
                
                Advice:
                "Disable authentication for accounts that have old (pre-4.1) password hashes by setting secure_auth=1. You may do this from the command line, but be sure to also set it in your my.cnf/my.ini file so it is set properly when the server is restarted. Note that you should be sure any valid old accounts have new passwords generated before you disable this option.
                
                Also note that server-side support for pre-4.1 password hashes was deprecated in MySQL Server 5.6 and was removed in MySQL Server 5.7.5 (and later). For more information, see Migrating Away from Pre-4.1 Password Hashing and the mysql_old_password Plugin in the MySQL Manual.

            A high value indicates that MySQL is being forced to perform full table joins (which are performance-intensive) instead of using indexes. This suggests a need for greater indexing of the corresponding tables. If this value is not 0, you should carefully check the indexes of your tables.

            Controls the number of binary log commit groups to collect before synchronizing the binary log to disk. When sync_binlog=0, the binary log is never synchronized to disk, and the server relies on the operating system to flush the binary log's contents from time to time as for any other file. When sync_binlog is set to a value greater than 0, this number of binary log commit groups is periodically synchronized to disk.
            
            When sync_binlog=1, all transactions are synchronized to the binary log before they are committed. Therefore, even in the event of an unexpected restart, any transactions that are missing from the binary log are only in prepared state. This causes the server's automatic recovery routine to roll back those transactions. This guarantees that no transaction is lost from the binary log, and is the safest option. However this can have a negative impact on performance because of an increased number of disk writes. Using a higher value improves performance, but with the increased risk of data loss.
            
            When sync_binlog=0 or sync_binlog is greater than 1, transactions are committed without having been synchronized to disk. Therefore, in the event of a power failure or operating system crash, it is possible that the server has committed some transactions that have not been synchronized to the binary log. Therefore it is impossible for the recovery routine to recover these transactions and they will be lost from the binary log.
            
            The default value of sync_binlog is 1, which is the safest choice, but as noted above can impact performance.
            
            Default Value:	1

            How many threads the server should cache for reuse. When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there are fewer than thread_cache_size threads there. Requests for threads are satisfied by reusing threads taken from the cache if possible, and only when the cache is empty is a new thread created. This variable can be increased to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections. Normally, this does not provide a notable performance improvement if you have a good thread implementation. However, if your server sees hundreds of connections per second you should normally set thread_cache_size high enough so that most new connections use cached threads. By examining the difference between the Connections and Threads_created status variables, you can see how efficient the thread cache is. For details, see Section 5.1.9, “Server Status Variables”.
            
            The default value is based on the following formula, capped to a limit of 100:

            The maximum size of internal in-memory temporary tables. This variable does not apply to user-created MEMORY tables.
            Default: 16 Mb
            The actual limit is determined from whichever of the values of tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size is smaller. If an in-memory temporary table exceeds the limit, MySQL automatically converts it to an on-disk temporary table. As of MySQL 5.7.5, the internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine option defines the storage engine used for on-disk temporary tables. Prior to MySQL 5.7.5, the MyISAM storage engine is used.
            Increase the value of tmp_table_size (and max_heap_table_size if necessary) if you do many advanced GROUP BY queries and you have lots of memory.
            You can compare the number of internal on-disk temporary tables created to the total number of internal temporary tables created by comparing the values of the Created_tmp_disk_tables and Created_tmp_tables variables.

      name: 'MySQL: Binary Logging Not Synchronized To Disk At Each Write'
      priority: WARNING
      description: |
        By default, the binary log contents are not synchronized to disk. If the server host machine or operating system crash, there is a chance that the latest events in the binary log are not persisted on disk. You can alter this behavior using the sync_binlog server variable. If the value of this variable is greater than 0, the MySQL server synchronizes its binary log to disk (using fdatasync()) after sync_binlog commit groups are written to the binary log. The default value of sync_binlog is 0, which does no synchronizing to disk - in this case, the server relies on the operating system to flush the binary log's contents from time to time as for any other file. A value of 1 is the safest choice because in the event of a crash you lose at most one commit group from the binary log. However, it is also the slowest choice (unless the disk has a battery-backed cache, which makes synchronization very fast).
        Advice:
        "Set sync_binlog = 1 within the [mysqld] section of your my.cnf/my.ini file to ensure the greatest safety for recovering from hardware, OS, and MySQL server crashes.
        
        Recommended Action
