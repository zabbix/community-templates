# IPFire by Zabbix Agent Active

## Description

This template monitors an [IPFire](https://www.ipfire.org/) [appliance](https://www.lightningwirelabs.com/products/ipfire/appliances) or [instance](https://www.ipfire.org/download)

## Overview

For Zabbix version: 6.4

Supports monitoring of:
- IPFire general stats (Number of current DHCPd clients)
- IPFire services (default IPFire services and possible Addon services)
- Pakfire status (Installed version, Available update(s))
- Network stats (Line quality, Open Connections, Firewall hits)
- OpenVPN clients and stats (OpenVPN client discovery, OpenVPN client properties, Traffic stats, Client/Server/CA Certificate validation)

Use in conjunction with a default Template OS Linux-template for CPU/Memory/Storage monitoring of the IPFire appliance/instance.

This template was created for:

- IPFire 2.29 - Core update 185

**Warning**: This template will *NOT* work on earlier versions of IPFire due to changes to the Zabbix Agent addon.

## Setup

- Install and configure [IPFire addon `zabbix_agentd`](https://wiki.ipfire.org/addons/zabbix_agentd) using Pakfire
- Make sure the IPFire builtin specific userparameters are enabled in `/etc/zabbix_agentd/zabbix_agentd.conf` (which should be by default)
- Copy `template_ipfire_services.conf` into the folder with Zabbix agent configuration (`/etc/zabbix_agentd/zabbix_agentd.d/` on IPFire)
- Copy `ipfire_services.pl` into the folder with Zabbix agent scripts (`/etc/zabbix_agentd/scripts/` on IPFire) and make it executable for user `root`.
- Unless you have your own custom sudoers config for zabbix; Copy `zabbix_agentd_user` into the folder with sudoers configuration (`/etc/sudoers.d`) to allow Zabbix agent to run `ipfire_services.pl` as root user.
  Otherwise, make sure the contents of `zabbix_agentd_user` from this template are added to your custom `/etc/sudoers.d/zabbix_agentd_user` file.
- Restart Zabbix agent.

## Zabbix configuration

No specific Zabbix configuration is required

#### Notes about $IPFIRE.SERVICE.TRIGGER
This template does not 'detect' if you have manually disabled a service in IPFire, so by default it will alarm you when any service is down. This is done on purpose so that you will also be notified if a service is unintentionly disabled.

To disable the trigger for a specific service (because it is disabled or you just don't want notifications about that service) add a host macro `{$IPFIRE.SERVICE.TRIGGER:"<service>"}` to the IPFire host and set it to `0`. 

For example to disable the OpenVPN service trigger add `{$IPFIRE.SERVICE.TRIGGER:"openvpn"}` to the host. Check the discovered IPFire service item-keys for the correct service-name of each service.

Or you could opt to use the variables `{$IPFIRE.SERVICENAME.MATCHES}` and/or `{$IPFIRE.SERVICENAME.NOT_MATCHES}` to filter out services
you don't want to be monitored at all.

#### OpenVPN Client discovery
This template is actually a set of 2 and includes a second template `IPFire OpenVPN Client by Zabbix agent` specificaly for use by the OpenVPN Client discovery defined in the main template `IPFire by Zabbix agent active`.

If the OpenVPN Service of the IPFire instance is enabled, the main template will discover any configured OpenVPN clients (see `{$IPFIRE.OVPN.*}` macro's to set filters), create those as new hosts in Zabbix and link the `IPFire OpenVPN Client by Zabbix agent` template to them.
Those client hosts will then start collecting OpenVPN statistics specific to those clients.
