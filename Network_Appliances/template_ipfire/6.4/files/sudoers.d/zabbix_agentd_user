# Include file for sudoers file
#
# This is needed for some userparameters to be able to execute commands that only run as root (using sudo)
# e.g. /usr/bin/openssl or /usr/sbin/smartctl
#
# USE AT YOU'RE OWN RISK. USING THIS WRONG CAN RESULT IN A SECURITY BREACH!
#
# Some hints:
# - It is strongly recommended to edit this file only using the visudo -f <filename> command. If you mess up this file,
#   you might end up locking yourself out of your system!
# - Append the full path incl. parameters to each command, using "," as separator.
# - Only add commands you really need. Zabbix should not have more rights than it has to.
