        ## Description
        
        Zabbix template for Microsoft Windows Server. Tested on Microsoft Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2 and 2016. It may work with earlier versions, but some items (with missing performance counters) may be unsupported. Tested on Zabbix 3.4.0. It may work with earlier versions, but some items (for example service.info[service,<param>]) may be unsupported. Mantas Tumenas. mantas.tumenas@gmail.com
        
        ## Overview
        
        Zabbix template for Microsoft Windows Server.
        
        
        Features:
        
        
        * Performance counters.
        * CPU Low Level Discovery.
        * Mounted file system Low Level Discovery.
        
        
        Difference from default Windows OS template:
        
        
        * CPU's discovery and triggers per CPU's.
        * Mounted file system discovery and triggers per logical disk.
        * More items and triggers prototypes for Mounted file system discovery.
        * Triggers are oriented for Microsoft Windows Server running Microsoft SQL Server.
        
        
        Missing:
        
        
        * Network interface items.
        
        
        Supported versions: Tested on Microsoft Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2 and 2016. It may work with earlier versions, but some items (with missing performance counters) may be unsupported. Tested on Zabbix 3.4.0. It may work with earlier versions, but some items (for example service.info[service,]) may be unsupported.

            Pages Input/sec is the rate at which pages are read from disk to resolve hard page faults. Hard page faults occur when a process refers to a page in virtual memory that is not in its working set or elsewhere in physical memory, and must be retrieved from disk. When a page is faulted, the system tries to read multiple contiguous pages into memory to maximize the benefit of the read operation. Compare the value of Memory\\Pages Input/sec to the value of Memory\\Page Reads/sec to determine the average number of pages read into memory during each read operation.
            
            Threshold: More then 10 page file reads per second.

            Threshold:  greater than 50%, it represents an I/O bottleneck.
            
            Symptoms. Third-party monitoring tool may generate multiple alarm events during times when your disk is very busy. If you monitor the Physical %Disk Time on your Windows based computer, you may note that the value may go over 100% if your computer is very busy. For example, this could occur if you are copying a large amount of files, or you are copying multiple large files, and so on.
            
            Cause. This behavior can occur because some controllers allow the operating system to use overlapping input/output operations for multiple outstanding requests. The disk performance counters time the responses by using a 100 nanosecond precision counter, and then report the cumulative statistics for a given sample time. This sample time could go over 100% if, for example, you have 10 requests that completed in 2 milliseconds each in a 10 millisecond sampling interval. If you have multiple disks in a Raid arrangement, the overlapped input/output happens because the operating system can read and write to multiple disks, and this could show values that are higher than 100% for this counter.
            Status. This behavior is by design.

            This measures the average time, in seconds, to read data from the disk. If the number is larger than 25 milliseconds (ms), that means the disk system is experiencing latency when reading from the disk. For mission-critical servers hosting SQL Server® and Exchange Server, the acceptable threshold is much lower, approximately 10 ms. The most logical solution here is to replace the current disk system with a faster disk system.
            
            Threshold: Average disk responsiveness is slow – more than 15 ms.
            Average disk responsiveness is very slow – more than 25 ms.

            Indicates that the kernel has switched the thread it is running on a processor. A context switch occurs each time a new thread runs, and each time one thread takes over from another. A large number of threads is likely to increase the number of context switches. Context switches allow multiple threads to share time slices on the processors, but they also interrupt the processor and might reduce overall system performance, especially on multiprocessor computers. You should also observe the patterns of context switches over time.

The processor queue is the collection of threads that are ready but not able to be executed by the processor because another active thread is currently executing. A sustained or recurring queue of more than two threads is a clear indication of a processor bottleneck. You may get more throughput by reducing parallelism in those cases. You can use this counter in conjunction with the Processor\% Processor Time counter to determine if your application can benefit from more CPUs. There is a single queue for processor time, even on multiprocessor computers. Therefore, in a multiprocessor computer, divide the Processor Queue Length (PQL) value by the number of processors servicing the workload. If the CPU is very busy (90 percent and higher utilization) and the PQL average is consistently higher than 2 per processor, you may have a processor bottleneck that could benefit from additional CPUs. Or, you could reduce the number of threads and queue more at the application level. This will cause less context switching, and less context switching is good for reducing CPU load. The common reason for a PQL of 2 or higher with low CPU utilization is that requests for processor time arrive randomly and threads demand irregular amounts of time from the processor. This means that the processor is not a bottleneck but that it is your threading logic that needs to be improved.

                Available MBytes is the amount of physical memory available to processes running on the computer, in Megabytes, rather than bytes as reported in Memory\Available Bytes. The Virtual Memory Manager continually adjusts the space used in physical memory and on disk to maintain a minimum number of available bytes for the operating system and processes. When available bytes are plentiful, the Virtual Memory Manager lets the working sets of processes grow, or keeps them stable by removing an old page for each new page added. When available bytes are few, the Virtual Memory Manager must trim the working sets of processes to maintain the minimum required.
                
                Threshold: Low on available memory – less than 10% available.
                Very low on available memory – less than 5% available.
                Decreasing trend of 10 MB’s per hour. This could indicate a memory leak.

                    This measures the average time, in seconds, it takes to write data to the disk. If the number is larger than 25 ms, the disk system experiences latency when writing to the disk. For mission-critical servers hosting SQL Server and Exchange Server, the acceptable threshold is much lower, approximately 10 ms. The likely solution here is to replace the disk system with a faster disk system.
