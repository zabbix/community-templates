        ## Overview
        
        **Template for HP servers with iLO 5 controller.**
        
        
         
        
        
        * #### Tested on ProLiant DL360 Gen10 with firmware version = 1.40 Feb 05 2019
        * #### You must add one macro on the server or on the template with the name:
        
        
        {$SNMP\_COMMUNITY} with the community to be used
        
        
        * #### All the items was created with "SNMPv2 agent"
        * #### Make sure your iLO is reachable from the zabbix server/proxy, test with:
        
        
        snmpstatus -v 2c -c public 192.168.0.1
        
        
         
        
        
        Based on @Wisenetman iLO 4 template

                HP Automatic Server Recovery (ASR) is reporting a "degraded" or "failed" state.  ASR is a watchdog timer which automatically restarts a server if the server hangs or crashes.
                
                When a server is restarted by ASR, a flag is set, and an alert is triggered until the flag is reset.

                            "Array Accelerator Board Backup Power Status.
                
                            This monitors the status of each backup power source on the board.  
                            The backup power source can only recharge when the system has 
                            power applied. The type of backup power source used is indicated 
                            by cpqDaAccelBackupPowerSource.
                
                            The following values are valid:
                
                            Other (1)
                              Indicates that the instrument agent does not recognize
                              battery status.  You may need to update your software.

                              The battery power is less than 75%.  The Drive Array
                              Controller is attempting to recharge the battery.  A
                              battery can take as long as 36 hours to fully recharge.
                              After 36 hours, if the battery has not recharged, it is
                              considered failed.

                              The battery pack is below the sufficient voltage level and
                              has not recharged in 36 hours.  Your Array Accelerator board
                              needs to be serviced.
                
                            Degraded (5)
                              The battery is still operating, however, one of the batteries
                              in the pack has failed to recharge properly.  Your Array
                              Accelerator board should be serviced as soon as possible.
                
                            NotPresent (6)
                              There are no batteries associated with this controller.

                    The battery provides backup power for the cache memory, to prevent data loss in the event of a power failure.  This battery has failed, so the Drive Array Controller will disable that cache, and disk performance will be bad until the battery is replaced.  The battery needs to be replaced.  Suggested actions are to write a ticket to replace the battery, then acknowledge the alert, writing the ticket number in the notes.  This will prevent a stream of continuing alerts.
                    
                    When the battery is on the edge of failing, it can move in and out of the failed state. This can have the effect of restarting an alert which has already been acknowledged.  To prevent this, this trigger is held until there has been no failure reported in the last 24 hours.

                    This alert normally is normally means that redundancy has been lost because an underlying physical drive has failed.  This means that now a single drive failure could cause data loss.  This alert is normally accompanied by an alert from the physical drive which has failed.   Suggested actions are to write a ticket to replace the failed physical drive, then acknowledge the physical and logical drive alerts, writing the ticket number in the notes.

                            "Logical Drive Fault Tolerance.
                
                            This shows the fault tolerance mode of the logical drive.
                            The following values are valid for the Logical Drive Fault
                            Tolerance:
                
                            None (2)
                              Fault tolerance is not enabled.  If a physical drive reports
                              an error, the data cannot be recovered by the drive array
                              controller.
                
                            Mirroring - RAID 1/RAID 1+0 (3)
                              For each physical drive, there is a second physical drive
                              containing identical data. If a drive fails, the data can be
                              retrieved from the mirror drive. 
                
                            Data Guard - RAID 4 (4)
                              One of the physical drives is used as a data guard drive and
                              contains the exclusive OR of the data on the remaining drives.
                              If a failure is detected, the drive array controller rebuilds
                              the data using the data guard information plus information
                              from the other drives.
                
                            Distributed Data Guard - RAID 5 (5)
                              Distributed Data Guarding, sometimes referred to as RAID 5,
                              is similar to Data Guarding, but instead of storing the parity
                              information on one drive, the information is distributed across
                              all of the drives.  If a failure is detected, the drive array
                              controller rebuilds the data using the data guard information
                              from all the drives.
                
                            Advanced Data Guarding - RAID 6 (7)
                              Advanced Data Guarding (RAID ADG) is the fault tolerance method
                              that provides the highest level of data protection.  It
                              'stripes' data and parity across all the physical drives in the
                              configuration to ensure the uninterrupted availability of
                              uncorrupted data.  This fault-tolerance method is similar to
                              distributed data guard (RAID 5) in that parity data is
                              distributed across all drives in the array, except in RAID ADG
                              the capacity of multiple drives is used to store parity data.
                              Assuming the capacity of 2 drives is used for parity data,
                              this allows continued operation despite simultaneous failure of
                              any 2 drives in the array, whereas RAID 4 and RAID 5 can only
                              sustain failure of a single drive.
                
                           RAID 50 (8)
                              Distributed data guarding (RAID 5) with multiple parity groups.
                
                           RAID 60 (9)
                              Advanced data guarding (RAID 6) with multiple parity groups."
